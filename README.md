# UnleashedTracker Addon for Turtle WoW

**UnleashedTracker** is a simple World of Warcraft (Turtle WoW 1.18) addon for Warlocks.  
It tracks the Unleashed Potential buff on your demon and displays its icon, alongside a duration and a number of stacks.

## Features
- Easy to install
- Type `/unleashed` in order to lock or unlock the icon
- Once unlocked, resize the icon with shift + scroll wheel, and move the icon's position with shift + left click.

## Installation
0. You need to have SuperWoW installed for the addon to work. Without it, the addon does not work.
1. Place the `UnleashedTracker` folder in your `Interface/AddOns` directory.
2. Make sure `UnleashedTracker.lua`, `UnleashedTracker.toc` are all in the folder.
3. Restart WoW.
4. Enable the addon in the AddOns list if it's not enabled by default.
